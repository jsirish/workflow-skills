description: Run the executable test/lint layer locally — PHPUnit, PHPCS, PHPStan, npm lint/build/test, Python ruff/pytest, shellcheck, and project-declared custom checks (.local-ci.json) — auto-fixing where a fixer exists, then reporting pass/fail. Augments LLM code review (/code-review, pr-review-toolkit), which never actually runs tests. USE THIS SKILL when asked to "run ci", "run the tests", "run local ci", "check before opening a PR", "run the checks", "does it pass", or to verify a change before review/merge. Replaces per-project tests.sh scripts. Self-contained — bundles scripts/local-ci.sh.

# Local CI

LLM review (`/code-review`, `pr-review-toolkit`) reasons about code but **never executes a test suite**. This skill fills that gap: it detects which check configs a project has and runs the matching checks, the same canonical set `silverstripe/gha-ci` runs in CI — PHPUnit, PHPCS, PHPStan, the npm scripts, and (for Python) ruff + pytest. It also covers shell projects that have adopted shellcheck (via `.shellcheckrc`) and, via a project-committed `.local-ci.json`, any custom entrypoint a project's real CI actually runs.

It is the executable counterpart to review, not a replacement. Run it, then feed the summary into the review.

## When to use

- After writing a feature, before opening a PR.
- As the test pass alongside `/code-review` or `pr-review-toolkit` — run this first, then review with the results in hand.
- Before `/merge-pr`, to confirm the branch is green locally.

Cadence: `feature-dev` → **`/local-ci`** → push → `/code-review` or `/pr-review-toolkit` → `/merge-pr` → `/handoff`.

## What it runs (gating by config presence)

**Every check is WARN-by-default** — a no-flag run never blocks (`exit 0`), it just surfaces
findings in the SUMMARY. Pass `--strict` to escalate the whole run to FAIL, or a scoped
`--strict-build` / `--strict-lint` to escalate just that category. The one exception is a
**broken local-ci setup** (malformed `.local-ci.json`) — that's always a hard FAIL, `--strict`
or not, because it isn't a finding to review, it's local-ci itself failing to run.

| Check | Fires when present | Command |
|---|---|---|
| composer validate | `composer.json` present | `composer validate --strict` (genuine errors: WARN; FAIL with `--strict`. `--strict`-only cosmetic warnings always WARN) |
| composer install | `vendor/` missing or `--fresh-deps` | `composer install` (else `--dry-run` resolve check) (WARN; FAIL with `--strict`) |
| dev/build | `vendor/bin/sake` (SilverStripe) | `sake dev/build flush=1` (WARN; FAIL with `--strict-build` or `--strict`) |
| PHPUnit | `phpunit.xml` / `.dist` | `vendor/bin/phpunit` (config present but binary missing → WARN, not silently skipped; test failures → WARN, FAIL with `--strict`) |
| PHPCS | `phpcs.xml` / `.dist` | `phpcbf` (auto-fix) → `phpcs --standard=…` (config present but binary missing → WARN, not silently skipped; findings → WARN, FAIL with `--strict-lint` or `--strict`) |
| PHPStan | `phpstan.neon` / `.dist` | `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` (config present but binary missing → WARN, not silently skipped; findings → WARN, FAIL with `--strict-lint` or `--strict`) |
| JS lint | `package.json` lint script or eslint config | `eslint --fix` → `npm run lint` (findings → WARN, FAIL with `--strict-lint` or `--strict`) |
| JS build | `package.json` build script | `npm run build` (WARN; FAIL with `--strict`) |
| JS test | `package.json` test script | `npm test` (npm placeholder script is skipped) (WARN; FAIL with `--strict`) |
| Python lint | `[tool.ruff]` in `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`/`.ruff.toml`, or a ruff hook in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | `ruff check --fix` → `ruff check` (WARN; FAIL with `--strict`) |
| Python test | pytest available + tests present | `pytest -q` with cwd forced onto `PYTHONPATH` (no tests → SKIP, not FAIL) (WARN; FAIL with `--strict`) |
| Behat | `behat.yml` | **opt-in** via `--with-behat` (needs a browser/driver) (WARN; FAIL with `--strict`) |
| Shellcheck | `*.sh` files present (tracked or untracked-but-not-ignored) and `.shellcheckrc` exists, or forced via `--with-shellcheck` | `shellcheck` over every matching file (dialect autodetected per-file from its shebang; adopted-but-missing-binary → WARN). Deliberately config-only, like the Python lint row below — no "shell-only project" auto-adopt, since shellcheck's default sensitivity would otherwise swamp a project's very first run with no escape hatch (findings → WARN; FAIL with `--strict`) |
| Custom checks | `.local-ci.json` at the project root | Runs each declared command as its own check (`jq` missing → WARN; malformed file or a check missing `"run"` → **always FAIL**, regardless of `--strict`; a declared check's own failure → WARN, FAIL with `--strict`) |

The legacy `phpmd` / `phploc` / `pdepend` / `phpdox` tools some old `tests.sh` scripts ran are intentionally **not** included — no project CI actually runs them.

### Custom checks (`.local-ci.json`)

For a project whose real CI isn't shaped like any of the language drivers above — e.g. a pure-shell repo that also runs `jq`-based manifest validation or its own test harness — commit a `.local-ci.json` at the project root:

```json
{
  "checks": [
    { "label": "manifest validation", "run": "jq -e '.name' plugin.json >/dev/null" },
    { "label": "hook tests", "run": "sh tests/run.sh" }
  ]
}
```

Each entry becomes its own `custom[<dir>]: <label>` row in the SUMMARY, executed via `bash -c` and recorded PASS/WARN (FAIL with `--strict`) like any other check. **Trust model:** this is identical to local-ci already running a project's own npm/composer scripts — it executes commands the project itself authored and committed. Requires `jq` on the host to parse the file; if `jq` is missing, this driver WARNs instead of silently skipping. A malformed `.local-ci.json` (not valid JSON, or a check missing `"run"`) is a **broken setup, not a finding** — it always FAILs, `--strict` or not. Custom checks run regardless of `--no-fix` — same as PHPUnit/npm test/pytest above; only the auto-fixer sub-steps (phpcbf / eslint --fix / ruff --fix) are gated by that flag.

## How to run

From the project root:

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/local-ci.sh
```

Options:

- `--dry-run` — detect checks and print what *would* run; execute nothing. Use this first on an unfamiliar project to see the plan before anything mutates files or the DB.
- `--no-fix` — report only; do not run phpcbf / eslint --fix / ruff --fix.
- `--no-build` — skip the SilverStripe `sake dev/build` step.
- `--strict` — escalate **every** check to FAIL on a non-zero exit, restoring hard-gating for the whole run in one flag. Implies `--strict-build` and `--strict-lint`. Use when you want the same hard gate GHA enforces, or before a push you want a real pass/fail on.
- `--strict-build` — treat a failing `sake dev/build` as FAIL rather than WARN, without escalating anything else. A subset of `--strict`.
- `--strict-lint` — treat failing phpcs/phpstan/eslint as FAIL rather than WARN, without escalating anything else. A subset of `--strict`.
- `--fresh-deps` — force a real `composer install` even when `vendor/` exists. Mirrors GHA's clean-install behaviour; slower and mutates `vendor/`. Use before a PR to verify a clean dependency resolution.
- `--with-behat` — also run Behat (off by default; it needs a browser + chromedriver).
- `--with-shellcheck` — force shellcheck even without a `.shellcheckrc`.
- `DIR …` — one or more dirs to scan. Default: the current dir plus the common
  sub-package dirs `frontend/ client/ backend/ app/` when they exist (handles
  monorepo layouts).

### Execution context

When a project has `.ddev/config.yaml`, **PHP** checks run via `ddev exec` and **composer** via `ddev composer` (the DDEV wrapper handles container mounts correctly). **JS and Python** checks always run on the host — DDEV web containers rarely carry the node/python toolchain. No flag needed; detection is automatic.

> **Note:** `ddev exec` always runs from the container's fixed working directory (`/var/www/html`), so a per-dir `cd` before invoking a PHP check doesn't reach the container on its own. local-ci works around this for a PHP dir that sits *nested* under a different project's DDEV root (e.g. a SilverStripe module developed as a live git checkout inside that project's `vendor/` tree, rather than a plain composer-installed package): when the scanned dir is its own git checkout (has its own `.git`) sitting under a `vendor/` path, local-ci checks specifically the directory enclosing that `vendor/` segment for `.ddev/config.yaml` - not a general ancestor walk - and if found, routes PHP/composer checks through `ddev exec -d <relpath-from-root>` (and `ddev exec -d <relpath> composer` for composer commands) instead of falling back to a bare-metal toolchain. This check runs *before* checking whether the nested dir has its own `.ddev/config.yaml` (some standalone-testable modules ship one for their own separate project) - the enclosing project's real dependency/DB environment is what a nested check needs, not the module's own unrelated container. This does not by itself prevent a nested module's own `composer.json` from pulling in a `require-dev` package whose post-install script assumes it's a project root (e.g. a test-scaffold recipe) - that risk exists regardless of ddev vs bare metal, and local-ci flags it with a WARN on the module's first install rather than silently letting it happen. Pass the nested dir as an explicit `DIR` argument to scan it (see Options above); scanning only the project root does not also check its nested `vendor/` live checkouts.

## Reading the result

The script ends with a `SUMMARY` block listing every check as PASS / FAIL / WARN / SKIP, then an `AUTO-FIX CHANGES` section (`git diff --stat`) showing any files a fixer mutated.

**A default (no-flag) run exits `0` even when real checks find real problems** — findings report WARN, not FAIL, unless escalated with `--strict` (or a scoped `--strict-build` / `--strict-lint`). The only thing that FAILs by default is a broken local-ci setup itself (a malformed `.local-ci.json`). **Read the SUMMARY text, not just the exit code** — a clean exit code no longer means a clean SUMMARY. Any automation that only checks the exit code will silently treat a WARN-covered failure as clean. The closing line reflects this too: `Result: all checks passed.` only when the SUMMARY has no WARN or FAIL rows; a WARN-only run instead prints `Result: no FAILs, but findings are WARN — read the SUMMARY above`.

A `composer install` or `npm install` failure (WARN by default) also short-circuits the checks that depend on it for that dir (dev/build, phpunit, phpcs, phpstan; or JS lint/build/test) — those show up as an explicit `SKIP …(install did not succeed)` row rather than silently vanishing from the SUMMARY.

When augmenting a review:
1. Run `local-ci.sh` and capture the summary.
2. If auto-fixes changed files, review that diff — those are real edits to your working tree.
3. Carry FAIL/WARN items into the review as concrete findings the LLM pass can then explain or contextualise. WARN is not a green gate for "done" — investigate it — even though it doesn't block a push.
4. Before a merge or a push you want a hard guarantee on, re-run with `--strict`.

## Status marker and the git-push gate

Every non-dry run writes a one-line marker to `<git-dir>/local-ci-status`:

```
sha=<HEAD-at-run> result=<PASS|FAIL|WARN|NONE> ts=<epoch>
```

`scripts/git-push-gate.sh` is a Claude Code `PreToolUse` (Bash) hook that consumes the marker and blocks `git push` only when the last recorded run **FAILed**, or a recorded **PASS** is stale or not an ancestor of HEAD. A PASS is valid at HEAD, or at an ancestor of HEAD for 4 hours (covers the run-ci, commit, push flow). A **missing marker** (no local-ci run recorded) and a **WARN** result both **allow the push** — WARN still isn't a green gate for "done" (investigate before declaring done), but it no longer blocks the push itself; a marker being missing means CI was never run against this repo, which shouldn't be able to trap a push behind a check that was never kicked off. The marker is stamped per repo: a run against one repo never green-lights another, and runs where nothing executed record `NONE`, not `PASS`.

Since every check is WARN-by-default, a **default run's marker is `PASS` or `WARN` — never `FAIL`** (only a broken `.local-ci.json` setup, or `--strict`/`-build`/`-lint`, can produce a FAIL marker). In practice this means the push gate is opt-in gating too: run without flags to see where things stand without risking a blocked push, or run with `--strict` when you want a marker that can actually block.

The command is parsed with a shell tokenizer, not a regex, so quoted `-C` paths, paths with spaces, `git -c <cfg>` options, multiple pushes in one compound command, and strings that merely mention "git push" are handled correctly. Known fail-open cases, by design: `jq` or `python3` missing, and git aliases that expand to push. Do not treat the gate as a security boundary; it is a workflow guard.

Register it in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `hooks.PreToolUse` (matcher `Bash`):

```json
{ "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/skills/local-ci/scripts/git-push-gate.sh" }
```

Bypass for an investigated, genuinely benign case: prefix the push with `SKIP_CI_GATE=1`.

## Notes

- **Behavior change:** every check used to hard-FAIL (non-zero exit) by default except phpcs/phpstan/JS-lint/dev-build. As of this change, **all checks are WARN-by-default** and a no-flag run exits `0` even with real failures. Any script or CI wrapper that invoked `local-ci.sh` and relied on a non-zero exit in default (no-flag) mode needs `--strict` added to preserve the old behavior.
- **`composer validate` and `composer install --dry-run` run automatically** on every PHP project — these are the same checks GHA performs implicitly when building the environment. If `vendor/` is missing, a real install runs instead. Use `--fresh-deps` for a full clean-install mirror.
- `composer validate` runs with `--strict`, which also surfaces recommendation-level warnings (loose version constraints, a stray `version` field, etc.), not just real problems (malformed json, out-of-sync lock) — and both share the same non-zero exit code. If `--strict` fails, the script re-checks with a plain (non-strict) `composer validate`: still non-zero means a genuine problem and records WARN (FAIL with `--strict`); exit 0 means the only issue was a --strict-only warning, which always records WARN. WARN surfaces in the SUMMARY and no longer blocks `git push` via the push gate (see below), but is still worth investigating before declaring the change done.
- `dev/build` failure is WARN by default because phpunit can sometimes self-bootstrap from its own bootstrap file. Pass `--strict-build` (or `--strict`) to make it a hard gate.
- The script never commits. Auto-fixes are left in the working tree for you to review and commit.
- A project with no recognised configs reports "nothing to run" rather than erroring.
